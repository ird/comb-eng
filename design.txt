Functions:

PERM [list] : returns a list of all of the permutations of the list

CHOOSE number : returns the function CHOOSE-N

CHOOSE-N [list] : returns a list of all the N-length subsets of [list]

CHOOSE [[buckets]] : returns a list of all the possible combinations achieved by picking one item from each bucket

BUCKET [buckets:string] : returns a function BUCKET-L as follows:

BUCKET-L [list] : returns a 'list of lists' of elements in the input list according to which 'bucket' in [buckets] they match. non matching items are excluded so this can be used to filter an input list

READ file:string : returns a list of the line separated values in 'file'


Rules:
expression = (fn expression)
expression = [list]
expression = number
expression = "string"


list = [expression, more_expressions]
more_expr = expression, more_expr
more_expr = EPSILON

fn = CHOOSE | BUCKET | PERM
